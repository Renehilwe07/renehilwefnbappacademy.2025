                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <P>Giraffes are highly social animals and live in herds of 15-20 female giraffes and some young males. Male calves will leave their mothers and the herd from around 15 months and join bachelor herds of other young males. The female calves tend to stay with the same herd as their mothers but can leave after the age of around 18 months old, and most often stay in the same areas as the family herd they grew up in.</P>
                    <P>Females are ready to mate from four years old and have a gestation period of 15 months – at birth, calves endure an incredible drop of 1.5m to the ground! Newborns weigh around 100kg and can be almost 2m tall at birth but their height will almost double within their first year. Newborns need to be so tall when they are born so they can reach up to suckle; they are reliant on their mother’s milk for the first 9-12 months of life but will start eating leaves from 4 months old.</P>
                    <P><strong>WHERE TO FIND THEM</strong></P>
                    <P>You will finf giraffes in abudant regions like Sub-Saharan Africa</P>
